            <h1>Who we are:</h1>
            <p>
              We are a dedicated group of pillow experts who are dedicated to
              the art of the pillow. We make strides in our research and
              understanding of pillows and proper body alignment to ensure that
              our clients reap any and all benefits from our pillows. We are
              organized and focused on our mission to equip you with the tools
              and weapons you’ll need to combat sleepless nights.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that no one should go to bed uncomfortable and wake up
              feeling worse than when they fell asleep. We are constantly
              researching ancient, classic, and modern methods of making
              pillows. Our team comes together daily to discuss findings and
              ideas in our “Pillow Talk” gatherings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team takes consumer feedback seriously and will always be
              there for our clients when it comes to the many demands of a
              restful night.
            </p>
            <p>For us there is no time to rest while achieving comfort.</p>
